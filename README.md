# Assesment---Data-Engineering

The main aim of the assignment was to predict profanity score of the twitter comment given the list of racial slurs or bad words. The description of the code is as follow:
1. I have created two functions in the code, one for getting dataframe of comments given path of the comments file and other for getting profanity score of the comment.
2. I have used pandas, re (Regular Expressions), nltk, and os packages of python.
3. The get_comments_from_file() functions takes 1 argument which is path to the file and returns dataframe of comments.
4. The get_profanity_score() function takes 2 arguments which are list of racial slurs and path to the file and returns dataframe of comments with profanity score.
5. Profanity score of the comment lies in 0-1 where low score means less racial slurs and high score which is 1 means more racial words.
6. I have commented working of code using comment as well.

Thank You.
